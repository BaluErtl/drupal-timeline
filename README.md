Introduction
-----------
Notable events in Drupal's history. My hope is that Drupal firms and individuals start with this data and make their own visualizations. This will result in a collection of pretty pages to showcase on January 15 2021, Drupal's 20th  anniversary

An inspirational example of a timeline comes from [Jetbrain's celebration of PHP's 25th anniversary](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/php-25/)

Please send PRs to enrich this timeline with more events and better descriptions.
