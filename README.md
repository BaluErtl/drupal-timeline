Introduction
-----------
Notable events in Drupal's history. My hope is that Drupal firms and individuals start with this data and make their own visualizations. This will result in a collection of pretty pages to showcase on January 15 2021, Drupal's 20th  anniversary.

- An inspirational example of a timeline comes from [Jetbrain's celebration of PHP's 25th anniversary](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/php-25/). 
- Anyone is welcome to copy the entries from the JSON and use them as desired. No need to actually fetch our JSON in your web app.
- If you do consume the JSON programmatically, please use our CDN: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/weitzman/drupal-timeline/drupal-timeline.json. Thanks [JSDELIVR](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh).
